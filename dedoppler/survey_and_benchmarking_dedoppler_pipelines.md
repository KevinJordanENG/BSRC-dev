# Survey and Benchmarking Dedoppler Pipelines

The work presented in this document provides a survey and analysis of dedoppler based SETI software pipelines. 

These pipeleines make use of a dedoppler search algorithm to identify technosignatures exhibiting doppler drift. Additionally, the pipelines perform the file handling, data preprocessing, hit-search for identifying potential signals of interest, and generation of output data files of potential these potential signals of interest.

The purpose of this document is to provide familiarity and a comparison of the capabilities, limitations, and performance between these pipelines. This includes a review of the interfacing options of these tools & experience using them, an analysis of the algorithms used, benchmarking and performance comparisons, and verification of output similarity.

The three SETI software pipelines surveyed were turboSETI, hyperSETI, and SETIcore. Their working repositories can be found below.
